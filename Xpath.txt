I know it is weird. And it is in reverse. But it is the way things are in XPath

preceding in XPath means after
following in XPath means before

//a[preceding::ol[@class='work index group']]

means to select only an (a) element that is after (ol) element with a class of "work index group"

if you have an XPath like this 

//a[text()='Next →']

you can add it as a second condition by removing the (//element or the *)
for Example

//a[preceding::ol[@class='work index group']][text()='Next →']

means to select only an (a) element that is after (ol) element with a class of "work index group" and the (a) element must contain "Next →"

you can chain multiple conditions like this

//element[Path condition1][Path condition2][Path condition3]

When you add a condition, all the conditions must be TRUE. To get an html element from XPath

XPath has another string functions other than text()
for Example

contains()
